# What's On?

This is an intuitive application designed to showcase local events to users through both map and list views. Currently in its early development stages, the app utilizes Expo Go and is set to integrate APIs for fetching live event data in future iterations.

# Development Highlights:

## 📚 Stack:

- Front-End: Built using Expo Go, leveraging React Native for cross-platform compatibility and a seamless user interface.
- Back-End (Planned): Future integration with RESTful APIs to fetch and display live event data. Potential use of Python and Django Rest Framework, considering past experience in these technologies.
- Containerization: Plans to employ Docker Compose for containerization, ensuring efficient build processes and streamlined deployment.

## 🧑🏻‍💻 Features:

- Map & List Views: Offers users the flexibility to view events either on an interactive map or as a consolidated list, enhancing user experience and accessibility.
- User Localization: Incorporates geolocation services to display events pertinent to the user's current location.
- Scalability: Designed with scalability in mind, allowing for the addition of features like event filtering, user reviews, and ticket purchasing integrations in future updates.

## 🛠️ Development:

- Version Control: Utilizes Git for meticulous version tracking, facilitating collaborative development and efficient feature branching.
- Error Handling: Commitment to implementing robust error handling mechanisms, drawing from previous experience with HTTP response codes to ensure app reliability.
- Performance Optimization: Plans to conduct thorough performance analyses post-API integration to identify and mitigate potential bottlenecks, ensuring a smooth user experience.

## Future Prospects:

As "What's On?" progresses beyond its nascent stage, the focus will shift towards integrating live event data through reliable APIs, enhancing the app's functionality and relevance. Continuous research and development efforts will be directed towards adopting best practices in both front-end and back-end development, ensuring the app remains responsive, user-friendly, and feature-rich.
